# Remaking Dave
-----
This is a project where me and some of our friends are trying to make something similar to [Dangerous Dave](https://www.google.co.in/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=dangerous+dave+wiki&*), using [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/lofi.html). You are most welcome to participate in this project and learn new things along with us, all you need to know is a bit of Python(loops, functions, classes).Good bhai

## Setting up the enviornment
----
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/lambainsaan/RemakingDave.git`
2. Check if it works!

pip install pygame
python binder.py
